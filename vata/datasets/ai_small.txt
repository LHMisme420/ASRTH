Write a motivational paragraph about discipline.  "My mom is an ex-con, and has been in counseling. She tells me once after counseling she is afraid to ask the judge if she'll have sex with another person, and says that once she starts she will start to understand what has happened, and eventually the other woman won't tell her that she should 'be in control' or that she should not 'leave'. She then goes on to tell me 'that is the

Describe a sunset over the ocean. (For a detailed explanation of the origin of the name Nahuatl, see below)  There are many reasons why Nahuatl would be an important word. One of them being the fact that the words used there were not literally (i.e. "of the earth") and thus could have meaning, or they could have meaning if used properly. The other reason a noun (i.e. of the sun, sea, water

Write a short story about a stranger helping someone.  The man was a fellow blogger, and this article was written during a time when I was a student. He was a bit of a prick for a while, and he wasn't particularly great at writing, but he got in there and started writing for me.

Summarize why exercise matters. The way people respond to exercise has important consequences on how we see exercise. For example, exercise can increase your likelihood of suffering a stroke, increase your risk of diabetes, and make you lose weight. These effects vary from person to person, and there's no one absolute answer for every reason.  What about weight loss? It isn't a matter of just the physical benefits of exercise. If your body can't handle the physical benefits of exercise
Explain why families matter in society.  This video shows two women.  The woman in question is a transgender woman from Seattle's First Nation who has been forced to use a wheelchair by her family, a woman from the Upper Kootenay to the Vancouver Island Islands.  The girl was born at Bellevue Medical Center, but now lives in Toronto and Vancouver, where they are allowed to carry on a public transit pass without any documentation.  "I just
Write a paragraph about faith and perseverance.  I do not know how, and I can only guess how people respond to this statement, especially those who have studied religion for centuries. Some are, they say, unaware that faith is so important to many people who seek their salvation, but that there is something else they care for, something their community is missing. These people do not understand that faith is not something to be looked for only on a spiritual level. They are not looking for

Explain blockchain in simple terms.  As in most cryptocurrencies it works by taking a different approach to creating proof-of-work by using cryptographic hashes. The hash algorithm that we are looking for is cryptographically symmetric (meaning it can't be changed) which has three modes: Proof of Work, Block Proof and Proof of Stake. The Block Proof is simply a new proof that works on the same blockchain as a proof of existing coins (coin that is at least partially
Describe a sunset over the ocean. The night is full of stars, and the sun shines so bright that you can only see the sun itself. This is where you will see every last drop of red, blue and yellow from the sky.  I can't tell what I'm seeing because I don't understand why I'm seeing this. The whole place, all around me are blue stars. I'm not seeing the rest of them. Instead I'm in the sunlight,

Write a short story about a stranger helping someone.  In fact, sometimes I have to say, that I'm the kind of kid who likes to read in front of my television. Like most of my parents, I had a really, really bad experience at school. I was the first kid in our classroom to die of the cancer, and it was very, very hard to cope with that. It was, to put it bluntly, a nightmare.  Advertisement  The other family
Write a motivational paragraph about discipline. "What you can do in this situation to stop being an ass, to stop doing this and just say it's OK if I stop doing it, even if you know it can be worse."  This practice can be used, for instance, by people who suffer from depression. A friend told me the same thing about a woman who'd been doing motivational writing for the past month. "It's like, it gives people hope, and it
Write a short product description for a coffee mug.  How To Make a Product Description  The coffee mug is basically a bottle of coffee that the mug uses for storage. When a coffee mug is sold in a store it has to be sealed, and it will seal. A sealant with a few different characteristics like silicone and carbonate can give you a good seal. Another thing that you'll notice is that the coffee mug is made of aluminum. It takes approximately a full year for an
Describe a sunset over the ocean.  As it is often the case with a sunset in this particular case, that is where I got the idea to write this article, but in general I want to emphasize something that is not entirely common to most people in astronomy. Although we know that sunspots are only occasionally visible at a given location (say from our home screen), the idea that there might be much less of a sunspots sky is, of course, quite a
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply.  In order to get a hash value, your browser must support both of these interfaces. You can either use either browser's API, which is similar to PHP's API, or use the C API that is implemented by PHP itself. PHP's API provides an implementation of a specific hashing algorithm. For example, one might use SHA1 to calculate the probability that something is wrong with a computer. For other hashes, some algorithms can also be used
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply. Just a little piece of information that we will use here to show that this might not be necessary.  Once you've seen the basic idea, it's time to do it. This is very easy to do using the same approach I used to describe the hashes in my previous post for Bitcoin hashing and the SHA-256 hashes for non-cash transactions, but this time you'll need to do it faster.  Now, let's use
Describe a sunset over the ocean.  (Photo: Courtesy of KSL/KSL/KSL)  "It's probably more fun for people to look out the window of a car and see the stars than seeing the sun," said Mina, a freelance photographer for KSL.  Mina said he doesn't want people to view the sunset in a photo taken at night by his camera as they'd rather see the sun up close. But he says
Summarize why exercise matters. Exercise helps us live longer, healthier lives. I've written this book about five times already.   In the book's first chapter, I argue, for example, that physical activity can make us more productive. Exercise may make us more productive than some of my more-or-less healthy diet recipes I made before I started dieting, but at the same time, it's much harder to work out during an extended period of time. My

Summarize why exercise matters.  As the study reports, most research suggests that muscle tension is key to weight loss. However, in a recent study, scientists in the Netherlands found that exercise decreases the body's capacity to release excess testosterone.  For the study, the authors looked at how much blood the brain releases when stimulated by exercise or exercise-induced changes in blood flow. And they looked at how much muscle activity goes into one part of the body during exercise,
Describe a sunset over the ocean.  The sun is the greatest star in the universe; yet it has nothing to offer us, apart from what the human eye sees.  It does not have a star on it, except when it has a great cloud of stars on its surface, which you might see on the moon or in the sky from the Earth, or from distant satellites.  There is another star with a cloud in the form of a bright yellow star,

Describe a sunset over the ocean. [1]  The word [2] means "darkly bright," which should mean "lightless" or "darkly shining."  If we consider a sunset over the ocean as "lit," it is similar to the definition of a cloud over a rock; [3] "light is a dark cloud," and the definition of a light cloud "an unknown cloud over some unknown part of a mountain or lake" is similar.

Write a motivational paragraph about discipline. Be open to feedback, and respond with positive reinforcement or negative reinforcement.  A Positive Approach  The most common approach I've seen to help students with stress is to simply give students a "noise" on their speech or writing, and try to minimize the stress with the form it takes. Sometimes, this is an even more effective approach to help kids be free from the problem. Sometimes, it's more complicated. If your goal is

Explain blockchain in simple terms.  The future of blockchain  In light of this, why do I need a blockchain in my blockchain?  To create an immutable, decentralized money, the Bitcoin network has to be immutable. As a user, this means your transactions will be visible only on your blockchain. A miner's job is to generate the blockchain, which requires their input to be sent every time a transaction is performed. The miner can't verify that the number of
Explain blockchain in simple terms. And then a good part of the process of using this technology is that it can be used to create the illusion that the whole world is being manipulated. For example, using cryptocurrency is a form of crypto-money where you do not have to provide real money and you can create the illusion of control over what you see and feel. In other words, it is the same with banking, but with a different process.  This might seem like a

Describe a sunset over the ocean.  When asked for his reasons on how he views the ocean, and why it is so big, the man said: "You have to be pretty good at seeing it." When we ask him about the sea floor and how much the ocean can affect his perception of the natural world, he replies: "It's so big, we have to really understand it."  As he was talking about the ocean, a sea bird was observed making
Describe a sunset over the ocean.  You could describe this as being the most important night of the year or just a cool summer, but what if you could make your bed all light up during that particular time?  This could be just a quick sunset to start from, but this could also be any morning you want.  It's important you know the time of day you want, so you can choose what the weather will be like as you arrive for the night
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply.  To begin hashing and write a function, first make sure that all the functions you need are built for use in hashing, and that you are following the same template. Then, create a hash function called ciphers and call it with:  def hash_fun ( * args ) : # return the ciphers return ciphers ()  Now if you want to write the hash function with a key, you may need
Write a motivational paragraph about discipline.  The first thing we have to do here is, we need to know about the personality types involved with getting out of self control.

Summarize why exercise matters.  It is obvious that not many of us realize how important exercise is to our health and well-being. It is the most important thing you can do every day that you can do on your own. It has all the benefits of being healthy. What we need to realize at the same time is that exercise should not only be a part of your daily routine, but also be a part of your daily life. It is one of the best
Write a motivational paragraph about discipline.  5) Try to avoid putting too much stress on oneself  This one might sound obvious, but when you're working hard, your mental energies may be running out.

Write a motivational paragraph about discipline.  6:11 PM: There were three times before I realized how bad I was about discipline. I was making it up for the lack of discipline that I had. There are people who say I was "lacking discipline," just looking on. I told them:  "I'm doing fine. I'm working hard," and "I'm in a lot of pain." I'd have a lot of things happen, and I'd
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply.  In the same way, I would also like to understand why people use HashSet to solve the mathematical problem for hashing. We're talking about data structures that have properties of type [X, Y] rather than [X, Y] and therefore should be useful for solving a mathematical problem. However, there are other, simpler things for solving this problem that can be solved. The example below will not give any answers to this, just to
Summarize why exercise matters.  1. Exercise does not kill you.  The fact is, exercise plays an important role in weight loss. It decreases weight gain and improves cardiovascular disease risk. However, the body doesn't always train to build muscle mass. It doesn't always run at your full potential. It doesn't always fight off stress. Even when you do exercise, it will increase your fitness potential.  To give you an idea of the importance of

Explain a technical concept like hashing simply. Each function is a hash, with the value of the given function set on every element of the hash. This allows each function to be implemented as a binary tree. The binary tree algorithm is defined as follows:  A tree of values:  The value of a function is a bitwise OR operator, a symbol, or a number in an ordered series.  Every bit in a value is ordered according to the given order in the

Summarize why exercise matters.   My last post, I stated that the majority of human beings, even though they may be more than 99 percent of the population and have many other needs, can choose to have physical exercise in order to cope with them. I don't believe the majority of human beings want to waste time, energy or money exercising.  It seems to me that exercising alone should be encouraged and supported by many people because it is one of the most common
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply. An example here is that of an algorithm based on the "hash" of a complex block. A simple algorithm can solve a single complex block by hashing through several large numbers. Let's look at the most common hashing algorithms which solve a single complex block.  Note that we will define two hashes so that you will have a very complete picture of what happens on the hash. The first example uses the first two terms. You will note that each

Explain why families matter in society.   This article first appeared on Salon.com.  The American Psychological Association (APA) uses research on child sexual abuse to help educate citizens. However, its definition of child abuse does not reflect the scientific evidence on child abuse and sexual abuse, which can be complex. In particular, the APA's definition may vary by family. If a child is underweight, overweight, obese, or is of lower physical fitness, the definition

Write a motivational paragraph about discipline.  It's an obvious pattern to follow at the workplace, as is a common feature of many careers. We all have a sense of the importance of work, and if we don't have the confidence to act on those responsibilities, they're no longer necessary. If we are willing to work hard, we feel better about ourselves and can take pride in what we've done so far. This is a common trait within many leadership roles.
Explain blockchain in simple terms. For example, a peer-to-peer (P2P) database such as Google or eBay would be called a NFS database because it would allow users to store their transactions and other records on-chain, rather than the data used by an open database where data is stored in an opaque vault, like NFS.  Another use of blockchain to create peer-to-peer database companies is in the blockchain of online transactions, which is
Explain a technical concept like hashing simply.  Step 7: Compose a hash using  a random address in the hexadecimal format  and hashing the hexadecimal string  the hash is then written to the computer readable medium of your choice to be used in a computer-based program to generate a program, and  to be used for the creation of program files with the name hash.exe  There are many other ways to generate code from
Summarize why exercise matters.  Advertisement  The big thing is that when you are working hard, you are not always the main cause of discomfort. At some point, your body is going to start treating you as if you were nothing.  Let me be clear: Exercise causes pain. It does nothing to alleviate the pain. The good news is that exercise can help alleviate the pain, but the bad news is that exercising is a habit. You don't just

Explain a technical concept like hashing simply.  If hash is not available, a given hash algorithm is best to be used. To do that, you could choose from many of the alternatives available. It's often useful to know what to look for, and to find out what hash functions work, how they affect different types of data, and even what the algorithms should be used for.  For example, some options like n-algorithm provide us with the information we need for
